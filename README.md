**Problem statement**

Football has been around for more than 150 years and just as its rules have evolved over time, so have the players. Talking about defenders, midfielders and forwards is an understatement as the players, even occupying the same field area, differ from each other along a variety of characteristics and tasks performed. This project aims to provide a new way to classify players into certain categories using unsupervised learning methods (PCA and hierarchical clustering).

The results of this ML project, thus developed, should not be intended as groupings of footballers based on their absolute way of playing, but rather as groupings of footballers based on their way of playing during a specific season (in this case, 2020/2021). Undoubtedly, a player can perform better if he is assigned tasks more suited to his characteristics, but this is not always the case

**Practical implications**

Different applications of a similar clustering model can help answer several questions: 

- From a tactical point of view: what kind of players are best suited to a particular style of play?; which players can best complement each other?; how has a player evolved over the years?; how does one league differ from another, based on the players who play in these?; how has the game evolved over the years?
- From a managerial point of view: what kind of players is it advisable to monitor through scouting and eventually invest in to meet the needs of the technical area?

**Possible improvements**

1.  This project has been developed using open-source statistics offered by fbref.com. Being able to have more complete and advanced statistics (e.g. kilometers traveled by each player or post-shot expected goals), it would be possible to obtain more accurate results.
2. This project has been developed using statistics relating to a single season (2020/2021). Therefore, factors such as injuries, coaching style of play and others can affect a player's stats leading to less accurate results. By aggregating statistics from multiple seasons, it would be possible to achieve more consistent results.
